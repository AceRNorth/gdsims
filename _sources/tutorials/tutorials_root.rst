Tutorials
=========

These tutorials will guide you all the way from a quick first run of the program to setting all the advanced options for more custom behaviour, building your skills step by step. They explore the command-line interface - an easy option for anyone, including those not as familiar with programming. Other ways of running the program are discussed in the :doc:`../user_guide/user_guide_root`.

All exercise files can be found in the ``docs/exercises`` directory on GitHub. 

The companion plotting library written in Python can be found in the ``plot`` directory. 

.. note::
    These tutorials have been written using a Windows 10 system with a g++ 13.1.0 compiler. The visualised data may vary slightly when using other systems or compilers due to differences in pseudo-random number generation.
